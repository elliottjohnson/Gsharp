;;; Requirements

* A Common Lisp.  Known to work: SBCL 0.9.12

* McCLIM.  The "Laetare Sunday" release is needed, along with
  ** spatial-trees;
  ** at least one means of displaying graphics: CLX is recommended,
     but the OpenMCL/Cocoa bridge is a possibility.

* Flexichain.  ASDF-INSTALLable or from common-lisp.net CVS, the
  flexichain project, flexichain module.

* ESA.  From common-lisp.net CVS, the climacs project, esa module.

Make sure ASDF knows how to find all of these projects.
