;;; Requirements

#|
* A Common Lisp.  Known to work: SBCL 1.0.8

* Certain pieces of Lisp software:

  ** McCLIM.  The "Orthodox New Year" release is needed, along with
     *** spatial-trees;

     *** at least one means of displaying graphics: CLX is
         recommended, but the OpenMCL/Cocoa bridge or the gtkairo
         backend are possibilities.

  ** Flexichain.  ASDF-INSTALLable or from common-lisp.net CVS, the
     flexichain project, flexichain module.

  ** MIDI.  ASDF-INSTALLable; current home at
     <http://doc.gold.ac.uk/isms/lisp/midi/>

  Make sure ASDF knows how to find all of these projects.
